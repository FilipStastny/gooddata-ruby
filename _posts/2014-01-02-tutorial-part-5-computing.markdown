perex: The logical data model (LDM) defines the facts and attributes in your project, as well as their relationships. Let’s have a look at how to create a project’s LDM using Ruby SDK. Then, we compare this method with other approaches.

*Warning*
This is most complex and as of now partially unfinished part of the SDK. We will just give you a glimpse of what is possible and direct you to the reference guide where many examples are described.

##Why do we care
We could make the same argument as we did with model definition. While creating reports interactively is preferred most of the time it is of utmost importance to be able to create them programatically as well. Maybe just for the sake of automation. So some common and probably tedious tasks can be run predictably. But you can go so far as to create whole projects programtically if you are able to devise many programs that will even create reports for you.

##First metric
Right now you are probably interested in how many developers are there in the project.

##First report

##Exporting your work

##What did you learn
You saw how to interactively create reports, save them, execute and export them. You should understand why we bother and how far we could take this.

##Where to go next
We have our first project. We created model, loaded data, created report and computed some data. The sad fact of project lifecycle is the fact that majority of the time is spent maintaining the project. What happens when a customer asks us for the change of the model? You will find out in the next part.
